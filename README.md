# Movies - Extract, Transform, and Load

UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 8
---

## Overview

In this module, we performed the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process on three data sources to generate an SQL database of movies. The movie information and links came from Wikipedia articles (in a JSON format) and the review information came from Kaggle (in CSV format). 

Once we had imported the data into various Pandas DataFrames, we cleaned up the data to remove extraneous columns, merge various formats, and convert data types where needed.
